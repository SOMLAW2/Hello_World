My name is Chisom Lawrence, I work as a registered nurse at Houston Methodist Hospital. I am currently enrolled for the masters in Data Science program at Boston University.  I am looking to make a transition from nursing to Data Science because I  believe this will enable me gain the knowledge needed to help improve patient's outcome through data.
